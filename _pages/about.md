Project 1:Coordinating directional switches in pigeon flocks: the role of nonlinear interactions
======
Focus on how white noise induces a switch in the rotation direction of a flock of pigeons. We use sparse Bayesian learning 
(SBL) method to extract interactions between individuals, and then we find that linear interactions dominate in the smooth part 
of the trajectory, while the percentage of higher-order nonlinear interactions becomes larger when switching trajectories. With 
the help of the Focker-Planck equation, an analytical solution is obtained for the mean time for a flock of pigeons to rotate from
a complete clockwise rotation to a complete counterclockwise rotation. Since the stationary probability distribution of S(t) (global mean spin)
satisfies the bimodal truncated normal distribution, additional calculations are required to correct the theoretical results. The theory agrees well 
with GPS data, and the results have been published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.[[PDF]](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsos.210649)



Project 2:Phase transition in nonlinear dynamics flocks: Natural Intrinsic Period induced by noise disturbance.
======
Introducing the principles of statistical mechanics to analyze second-order dynamical systems with independent noise 
terms excites me. In courses on stochastic processes, noise is always not considered to be the key to the problem, but 
in this project, noise is very good. It plays a key role in explaining why the pigeons' rotation direction switches from 
clockwise to counterclockwise. In the following work, our attention turns to the Vision-cone model, which is an improvement 
based on the famous Vicsek model. Although there are mature fluid mechanics tools such as Toner-Tu theory, used to describe 
the abrupt jump of the global order parameter, but we want to start from another perspective and develop some kind of theoretical
framework that does not rely on order parameters. In conjunction with the Fokker-Planck equation, we developed a mathematical tool 
called NIP (natural intrinsic period), combined with sub-index Coefficient of variation. It can well explain how white noise and some
dynamic parameters induce the system to produce rich phenomena, such as single ring, twist-like ring, or liquid crystal state.  [[PDF]](https://guanboshao2022.github.io/files/P1.pdf)[[SI]](https://guanboshao2022.github.io/files/SI1.pdf)


Project 3:Project 2:Phase transition in nonlinear dynamics flocks: Natural Intrinsic Period induced by noise disturbance.
======
Proposed a characterization method to describe the noise immunity of marginal ferromagnetism. And extended
this method to quantify the noise resistance capability of collective motion. Analyzed the Hamiltonian dynamics of marginal ferromagnetism, and obtained the format of Gibbs free
energy. Characterized the endogenous noise immunity of the bare potential family by expanding the Gibbs
free energy around the velocity refer.[[PDF]](https://guanboshao2022.github.io/files/P2.pdf)
